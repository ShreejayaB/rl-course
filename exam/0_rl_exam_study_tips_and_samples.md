 Study Ideas (an incomplete list of suggestions)
------

- __All__ course materials are fair-game. The prework checks could be helpful.
- Complete `rl_terms.md` in the resources folder.
- [Feynman Technique](https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/) for major course concepts and the learning outcomes and take-aways from each notebook.
- Complete the relevant sections of this [homework sheet](https://www.is.uni-freiburg.de/ressourcen/business-analytics/homework_reinforcementlearning.pdf).
- Attempt the exercises from Sutton and Barto book. The exam questions should not be as difficult as those exercises. In other words, those exercises are challenging and the exam is designed to be easier. Study hard; test easy.
