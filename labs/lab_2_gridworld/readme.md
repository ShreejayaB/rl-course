Student Assignment Submission Instructions
------

- Submit completed assignment on Canvas. 
- See Canvas for due date. Late assignments are only accepted for emergencies.
- You can name the `.ipynb` file anything. Canvas preappends your name during the upload process.
- You can submit multiple times. I only look at the last submission. It is best practice to submit early and often.

Grading notes:
------

- All assignments will be graded by hand. Any coding tests are guides for you.
- Each line of code you write must have a comment. Comments should always describe the logic behind the code. Comments most often answer the "why" of code choices.
- If there are function calls, please use keywords arguments to make your logic more explicit.
